Ingot is a user interface toolkit for [ROBLOX](https://roblox.com) that aims to make it easier to build complex user interfaces. Ingot extends the ROBLOX user interface objects with more complex components, like dropdowns and radio button groups.

At the moment Ingot is still in development and is not ready for release. Soon (tm). For documentation, see [the GitHub Pages site](https://memorypenguin.github.io/rbxingot).
